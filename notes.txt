for the tests to perform without caches. They should be run as root

couldn't use fastest c++ implementation as it used re2 library that is only available from Google code mercurial repo and it didn't compile.

for PHP the there wasn't any thread-ring test.

taskset for limiting cpus


Run the run.sh on the harkka dir to get the 50MB test file for the regexp tests.
Then run the tests by running the run.sh in {test}/{language} directories. 

run the genfiles.sh in harkka/io dir to generate the 1000 1m files and 1 1G file.

currently implemented tests:
- binary
- regex
- spectra
- thread (except PHP, doesn't exist)
- io
